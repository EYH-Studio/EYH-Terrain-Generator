🌍 EYH Terrain Generator

This is an open-source procedural terrain generation system developed by EYH Studio, primarily for Unity. While it utilizes Unity's Terrain and GameObject systems, the core logic (noise maps, heightmap generation, terrain stitching) is engine-agnostic and can be ported to other engines like Unreal Engine or Godot with minimal adjustments.

✅ Features:
- Multi-tile terrain support
- Heightmap-based elevation
- Modular noise layers (Perlin, Ridged, etc.)
- Customizable terrain sizes
- Optimized for large open-world games
